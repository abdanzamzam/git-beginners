---

### **6. Remote Repositories**  
- Setting up a remote repository.  
- Cloning a repository (`git clone`).  
- Pushing changes to a remote repository (`git push`).

---

### **7. Collaborating with Git**  
- Working with team members on the same repository.  
- Resolving merge conflicts.  
- Forking and creating pull requests.  

---

### **8. Ignoring Files**  
- Using `.gitignore` to exclude files and directories from version control.  
- Examples of common `.gitignore` configurations.  

---

### **9. Stashing Changes**

- Searching through commits (`git grep`, `git log -S`).  
- Using reflog to recover lost commits (`git reflog`).  

---

### **13. Working with Submodules**  
- Introduction to Git submodules.  
- Adding and updating submodules.  
- Removing submodules.  

---

### **14. Git Workflows**  
- Common Git workflows: Feature branching, Git Flow, and Trunk-based development.  
- Best practices for managing repositories in a team.  

---

### **15. Using Git with GitHub/GitLab**  
- Setting up SSH keys for authentication.  
- Understanding issues, pull requests, and project boards.  
- Automating workflows with GitHub Actions/GitLab CI/CD.  

---

### **16. Troubleshooting Git**  
- Resolving common errors and issues.  
- Recovering lost commits and branches.  
- Debugging merge conflicts.  

---

### **17. Git Best Practices**  
- Writing clear commit messages.
